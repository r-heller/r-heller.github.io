<br><br><strong>Data protection</strong><br><br>
The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. <br>
We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible. <br>
The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example through spam mails.<br>

<br><br><strong>VG Wort tracking pixel</strong><br><br>
This site uses "session cookies" from VG Wort, Munich, to measure access to texts in order to record the probability of copying. Session cookies are small units of information that a provider stores in the RAM of the visitor's computer. A randomly generated unique identification number, a so-called session ID, is stored in a session cookie. In addition, a cookie contains information about its origin and the storage period. Session cookies cannot store any other data. These measurements are carried out by Kantar Germany GmbH according to the Scalable Central Measurement Method (SZM). They help to determine the copy probability of individual texts for the remuneration of legal claims of authors and publishers. We do not collect any personal data via cookies. Parts of the accessible pages are provided with JavaScript calls, via which the accesses are reported to the Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort (VG Wort). The VG Wort thereby enables authors to participate in the distributions of the VG Wort, which ensure the statutory remuneration for the uses of copyrighted works in accordance with ยง 53 UrhG. It is also possible to use our offers without cookies. Most browsers are set to automatically accept cookies. However, you can deactivate the storage of cookies or set your browser to notify you as soon as cookies are sent. Data protection declaration on the use of the Scalable Central Measurement Procedure: Our website and our mobile web offer use the "Scalable Central Measurement Procedure" (SZM) of Kantar Germany GmbH for the determination of statistical characteristic values for the determination of the copy probability of texts. In the process, anonymous measurement values are collected. The access count measurement alternatively uses a session cookie or a signature, which is created from various automatically transmitted information from your browser, to recognise computer systems. IP addresses are only processed in anonymised form. The procedure was developed with due regard for data protection. The sole aim of the procedure is to determine the copying probability of individual texts. At no time are individual users identified. Your identity always remains protected. You will not receive any advertising via the system.
