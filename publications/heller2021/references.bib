  abstract = {Monocytes and lymphocytes elicit crucial activities for the regenerative processes after various types of injury. The survival of neurons exposed to mechanical and oxidative stress after traumatic spinal cord injury depends on a multitude of factors. In this study, we sought to evaluate a correlation between remission after traumatic spinal cord injury and the dynamics of monocyte subsets in respect to the lymphocytes' responsive potential, cytokine expression, patterns of trace element concentration and clinical covariates. We examined prospectively 18 (three female, 15 male) patients after traumatic spinal cord injury. Blood samples were drawn at admission and 4 h, 9 h, 12 h, 1 and 3 days as well as 1 and 2 weeks and 1, 2 and 3 months after the trauma. Analysis of cytokines (CCL2, IL-10, enolase 2, CXCL12, TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2) was performed using a multiplex cytokine panel. Plasma trace element concentrations of selenium, copper and zinc were determined by total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis; neopterin, selenoprotein P (SELENOP) and ceruloplasmin (CP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; and selenium binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) by luminometric immunoassay. The responsive potential of lymphocytes was assessed using transformation tests. The monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, and non-classical) and expression of CD14, CD16, CXCR4 and intracellular IL-10 were identified using a multi-colour flow cytometry analysis. The dynamics of the cluster of intermediate CD14-/CD16 +/IL10 +/CXCR4int monocytes differed significantly between patients with an absence of neurological remission (G0) from those with an improvement (G1) by 1 or 2 American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) steps (Kruskal-Wallis Test, P = 0.010, G0 \textexclamdown{} G1, AIS + : 1 \textexclamdown{} G1, AIS +: 2) in the first 24 h. These dynamics were associated inversely with an increase in enolase and SELENBP1 14 days after the injury. In the elastic net regularized model, we identified an association between the increase of a subpopulation of intermediate CD14-/CD16 +/IL10 +/CXCR4int monocytes and exacerbated immune response within 24h after the injury. These findings were reflected in the consistently elevated response to mitogen stimulation of the lymphocytes of patients with significant neurological remission. Early elevated concentrations of CD14-/CD16 +/IL10 +/CXCR4int monocytes were related to higher odds of CNS regeneration and enhanced neurological remission. The cluster dynamics of CD14-/CD16 +/IL10 +/CXCR4int monocytes in the early-acute phase after the injury revealed a maximum of prognostic information regarding neurological remission (mean parameter estimate: 0.207; selection count: 818/1000 repetitions). We conclude that early dynamics in monocyte subsets allow a good prediction of recovery from traumatic spinal cord injury.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Literature survey. OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the literature data on incidence, prevalence and epidemiology of spinal cord injury (SCI) worldwide and to study their evolution since 1977. SETTING: University Antwerp. METHODS: The literature from 1995 onwards was searched on Pubmed. To include evolutionary data, we incorporated the results of three older studies. RESULTS: Two studies gave prevalence of SCI, and 17 incidence of SCI. The published data on prevalence of SCI was insufficient to consider the range of 223-755 per million inhabitants to be representative for a worldwide estimate. Reported incidence of SCI lies between 10.4 and 83 per million inhabitants per year. One-third of patients with SCI are reported to be tetraplegic and 50\% of patients with SCI to have a complete lesion. The mean age of patients sustaining their injury at is reported as 33 years old, and the sex distribution (men/women) as 3.8/1. CONCLUSION: There is a need for improved registration of SCI, and publication of the findings in many parts of the world. This survey pleads for uniformity in methodology. The data show that the reported incidence and prevalence have not changed substantially over the past 30 years. Data from Northern America and Europe show higher figures for incidence, but prevalence figures have remained the same. Epidemiology of SCI seems to have changed during the last decades with a higher percentage of tetraplegia and of complete lesions. If such evolution is present worldwide, how it could eventually be prevented needs to be studied. SPONSORSHIP: Not applicable.},

  abstract = {The wound healing process that occurs after spinal cord injury is critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and limiting tissue damage, but eventually results in a scar-like environment that is not conducive to regeneration and repair. A better understanding of this dichotomy is critical to developing effective therapeutics that target the appropriate pathobiology, but a major challenge has been the large cellular heterogeneity that results in immensely complex cellular interactions. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to assess virtually all cell types that comprise the mouse spinal cord injury site. In addition to discovering novel subpopulations, we used expression values of receptor-ligand pairs to identify signaling pathways that are predicted to regulate specific cellular interactions during angiogenesis, gliosis, and fibrosis. Our dataset is a valuable resource that provides novel mechanistic insight into the pathobiology of not only spinal cord injury but also other traumatic disorders of the CNS.},
